Do automatic post-processing by doing the following:
(this example uses the latest tim step. To use another time step
modify the -time for sample, and modify in compareAll.gplt)

postProcess -func sampleDict -case .. -latestTime
gnuplot compareAll.gplt
firefox compareAll.html

To plot the residuals do the following:
(This example assumes that you have a log file in your case directory)
foamLog ../log
gnuplot plotResiduals.gplt
firefox residuals.png
