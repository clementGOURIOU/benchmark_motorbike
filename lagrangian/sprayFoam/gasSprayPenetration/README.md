## Motivation
One of the key stakeholders in this project is FM Global, whose primary concern is fire modelling and suppression. In this micro-benchmark, we deal with the main mechanism for fire suppression, namely via water spray, by which the liquid and evaporated species are mechanisms to reduce the enclosure temperature and/or directly to suppress the fire and source. This case uses the OpenFOAM Lagrangian solver to track the spray droplets trajectory through the mesh, coupled with the flow solver in exchange of mass (phase change), momentum (droplet and continuum fluid drag forces) and energy (needed to evaporate the liquid phase)

- Validation of the following solvers within the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework
in terms of macroscopic and microscopic spray development and vaporisation:

# Methodology

- The test case is based on the Engine Combustion Network
(ECN) workshop's *Spray-A* experimental configuration. ([ECN(a) (2019)](#ref1)).
- The *Spray-A* case is a basic single-hole non-reacting
spraying-into-a-closed-volume configuration; "well-characterized,
but is likely non-cavitating (and thus, unrealistic)."
([Arienti et al. (2012)](#ref2)).

#### Metrics

- The metrics to quantify the validations are ([Manin et al. (2012)](#ref3)):
  - Macroscropic spray development:
    - Liquid penetration vs time (liquid-length)
    - Vapor-phase penetration vs time
    - Mixture fraction profiles (both axial and radial)
    - Extinction profiles (both axial and radial)
  - Microscopic spray development:
    - Spray penetration and velocity in the near-field
    - Spreading angle
    - Microscopic features (fuel ligaments, droplet formation etc.)

#### Benchmarks

- The database of the experiments can be accessed through the

#### Definitions

**Liquid penetration:**
"Maximum distance from the nozzle outlet to the farthest axial position where
projected liquid volume in the cross-stream direction decreases to a specific
value.
The projected liquid volume is defined as
$`\mathrm{PLV} = \int \, \mathrm{LVF} dy`$, where $`\mathrm{LVF}`$ is liquid
volume fraction and $`\mathrm{PLV}`$ is projected liquid volume.
Two values for $`\mathrm{PLV}`$ are considered:" ([ECN(b) (2019)](#ref6))

```math
\int \mathrm{LVF} \, dy = 0.2\text{e-}3 \,
\text{[} \mathrm{mm}^3 \, \text{liquid} / \mathrm{mm}^2 \text{]}
```

```math
\int \mathrm{LVF} \, dy = 2.0\text{e-}3 \,
\text{[} \mathrm{mm}^3 \, \text{liquid} / \mathrm{mm}^2 \text{]}
```

In some studies, such as in ([Di Ilio et al. (2019)](#ref7), p. 7), the liquid
spray penetration "is defined as the maximum distance from the injector nozzle
to the farthest axial position where 95\% of the liquid mass is found."

**Vapor penetration:**
"Maximum distance from the nozzle outlet to where the fuel mass fraction
(or mixture fraction (author's note: if the system is reacting)) is 0.1\%."
([ECN(b) (2019)](#ref6)).

## Equation discretisation

- Spatial derivatives and variables: See `system/fvSchemes`.
- Temporal derivatives and variables: See `system/fvSchemes`.

## Numerical boundary/initial conditions

- Refer to `0.orig`.

## Pressure-velocity coupling algorithm

- PISO.

## Linear solvers

- Refer to `system/fvSolution`.

## Initialisation and sampling

- No initialisation/averaging.
- Refer to `system/controlDict` for function objects being used.

## Instructions to run the case
The setup for nref=1 (baseline) is tested in OpenFOAM v2206.

We have flexibility to scale the mesh simply by changing this (nref) parameter inside file system/parameters, and for each increment, the mesh might scale upto 8^(nref-1) than previous level.

Execution is typically a call to Allrun script with required number of processors as argument. e.g. ./Allrun 16

Selecting both nref and the number of cores gives flexibility to compare scalability. For example, one could use lower nref (1-3) to study scalability with lower core number, and go higher if larger hardware is available.

The case should build automatically according to 'nref' and number of processors requested. Any post-processing (like gnuplot) could be evaluated separately.


#### Illustrations

##### Vapor-phase penetration vs time

Preliminary results are as per plots above. The liquid and vapour penetration into the initially static gas field represent an appropriate baseline validation, against which benchmarking and several refinement studies will be performed.


## Bottlenecks
The bottlenecks to be addressed in exaFOAM using the release code series OpenFOAM-vYYMM are:
  - Scalability of combined flow and lagrangian OpenFOAM solvers
  - Computational load between the continuum and discrete particle solvers (number of particles versus mesh count).
  - Load-balancing and performance benchmarking as the lagrangian particles transport in space ? computationally this will manifest as particle tracks migrating from processor to processor and an associated change in the computational load per processor.

# Discussion

- "... the breakup model constant $`B_1`$ has a significant impact on the spray
modeling, since it controls the diameter reduction of secondary droplets.
Overrated values for $`B_1`$ may lead to a reduction of breakup phenomena
and increased liquid penetration. On the contrary, too low $`B_1`$ values may
result in higher diameter reduction rate, thus leading to increased spray
disintegration and reduced liquid penetration."
([Di Ilio et al. (2019)](#ref7), p. 4)
"Inappropriate choice of this constant can lead to unrealistic prediction
of the liquid phase behavior." ([Di Ilio et al. (2019)](#ref7), p. 6)
- "We emphasize that, in general, given a set of spray model parameters,
the simulation results are not grid independent. This is well documented in
literature, and an insightful discussion is available in first ECN workshop
Proceedings. Several numerical studies have led to the conclusion that both
liquid and vapor penetrations might be significantly affected by the mesh
resolution. To a certain degree, it was also observed that time-step size
might have not negligible effects on the numerical results."
([Di Ilio et al. (2019)](#ref7), p. 6)
- "Note that these gas velocities are small when compared to liquid (high-momentum) spray velocities (~400 to 600 m/s) and therefore, have little effect on the sprays." (https://ecn.sandia.gov/diesel-spray-combustion/sandia-cv/velocity-distribution/)

- "We notice that the effect of URANS turbulence
models on liquid penetration is not pronounced."
([Di Ilio et al. (2019)](#ref7), p. 7)
- "Conversely, there is a significant discrepancy among
the vapor penetration predictions over time."
([Di Ilio et al. (2019)](#ref7), p. 8)
- "The initialization of the turbulence kinetic energy k field may
affect significantly the simulation results. ...
Liquid penetration is however never affected by the choice of
the initial field of turbulent kinetic energy."
([Di Ilio et al. (2019)](#ref7), p. 8)
- Vapour penetration was not affected by changing the `breakupModel` (e.g.
switching from `RietzKHRT` to `RietzDiwakar`) or `breakupModel`'s settings.
It was mostly affected by the `dispersionModel` and `stochasticCollisionModel`.
- Liquid penetration was mostly affected by the `breakupModel`, particularly
by `B1` coefficient.
