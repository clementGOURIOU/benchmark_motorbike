//Mesh size parameter:
//   Set nref to refine the mesh in all directions.
//   nref must be integer,  >0
//   number of cells is ~4.xxM * 8^nref
//
//   nref=1 -> Baseline mesh ( 4.07M cells)
//   nref=2 -> Refined cells (29.13M cells): 2 times refinement in x,y,z

// Note that, the core of the snappyHexMesh is fixed size domain refined by nref factor
// However, the extrusion is performed to 'match' the last cell size of snappyHexMesh
//   cell size and nref factor times extrusion cells, hence the sum of geometric
//   progression series is different leading to change in size of domain, however this
//   should be still farfield domain with same BCs, hence this shouldn't affect simulation
